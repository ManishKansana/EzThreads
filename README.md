Dawg House

Description

Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a small-scale Facebook-like social media web app focused on Mississippi State students called "Dawg House". In version 1.0, users will be able to log in, log out, post timeline updates, send/accept friend requests, and like, comment on, and re-post the posts of their friends.

Features

Account Creation
Users will be able to create an account by choosing a unique dawgtag (username) and registering the dawgtag with an e-mail address, password, and first and last names.
Log in / Log out
A user will be able to log in to the website by correctly entering his or her dawgtag and password.
A user will also be able to log out of his or her account.
Posting a Bark
Users can post a block of text called a "bark" to their timelines.
They will also be able to edit the content of their barks.
Social Interaction
A user can send a "sniff request" (friend request) to another user to add that user to their "pack" (friend's list).
Users within a poster's pack will be able to see that account's barks and interact with them.
Bark interaction includes: giving the bark a treat (giving it a like), posting a yip (comment) on the bark, and howling (re-posting).
