## Description

### Objective
  The goal of this project is to develop a full-stack social media web app for developers.
  In version 1.0, users will be able to log in, log out, post timeline updates, send/accept friend requests, and like, comment on, and share the posts of their friends.

### Requirements
1. Create an Account
    - Users will be able to create an account by choosing a username and password.
2. Log in / Log out
    - A user will be able to log in to the website by correctly entering his or her username and password.
    - A user will also be able to log out of his or her account.
3. Posting a "Snippit"
   - Users can post a block of text called a "snippitz" to their timelines.
   - They will also be able to edit the content of their snippitz after posting.
4. Social Interaction
   - A user can send a friend request to another user to add that user to their friends list.
   - Users within a friend's timeline will be able to see that account's snippitz and interact with them.
   - Possible snippit interactions: liking, commenting, and sharing.
