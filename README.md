# ReConnect

## Description
  ReConnect is a social media platform that is geared towards software developers. With functionality similar to popular, generic social media platforms such as FaceBook, ReConnect allows a more close-knit setting for  developers to interact, share ideas, and make connections with like-minded individuals.

### Objective
  The goal of this project is to develop a full-stack social media web app for developers.
  Upon completion of the first version, users will be able to create an account, log in and log out with this account, post onto their personal timeline, send/accept friend requests, and like, comment on, and share the posts, or "snippitz", of their friends.

### Requirements
1. Create an Account
    - Users will be able to create an account by choosing a username and password.
2. Log in / Log out
    - Users will be able to log in to the website by correctly entering his or her username and password.
    - Users will also be able to log out of his or her account.
3. Create and Post a "Snippit"
   - Users can create a post, called a "snippit", and post it to their personal timeline.
   - This "snippit" will appear on the homepage of users who are friends with the poster.
   - Users will also be able to edit the content of their snippitz after posting.
4. View "Snippitz" on a Homepage
   - Users can view a homepage.
   - The homepage displays recent "snippitz" made by friends.
5. Send and Accept Friend Requests
   - Users can send friend requests to other users.
   - Users can accept pending friend requests from other users.
6. View Friends' "Snippitz" on a User Timeline
   - Users can view the profile of another user.
   - "Snippitz" posted by users are visible on their profile.
7. Interaction with "Snippitz"
   - A user can send a friend request to another user to add that user to their friends list.
   - Users within a friend's timeline will be able to see that account's snippitz and interact with them.
   - Possible snippit interactions: liking, commenting, and sharing.
